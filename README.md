# Calc.js

A simple, versatile evaluator that can be used to implement and safely evaluate DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)
in the browser. You have complete control over every operation performed, and this library takes care of the
nitty gritty of the parsing and such.

We can use this to create a simple in-browser calculator to evaluate things like:

```
10 + 4 / 2 * (3 - 1)
```

Or we can use it to manipulate table cells by evaluating something like:

```
MEAN(A1:A5) + SUM(C1:D2) - 10
```

Or we can build a small expression-based language that looks like:

```
foo = 2;
bar = 4;
wibble = foo * bar + pow(2, 10);
foo + bar + wibble
```

Or a range of other things.

In each case, we define the operators (optionally with precedence and associativity) and functions available
to the program and exactly what they do with their arguments, and this library takes care of the rest.

# Installation

You can install the latest release directly from github using `npm`:

```
npm install jsdw/calcjs#v0.2.0
```

# Basic Usage

First, you define a `Context` which determines how expressions will be evaluated. For a simple calculator,
we might define something like the following:

```
import { evaluate } from 'calcjs'

const ctx = {
    // We provide these operators:
    scope: {
        '-': (a: any, b: any) => a - b,
        '+': (a: any, b: any) => a + b,
        '/': (a: any, b: any) => a / b,
        '*': (a: any, b: any) => a * b,
    },
    // And define the precedence to be as expected:
    precedence: [
        ['/', '*'],
        ['-', '+']
    ]
}
```

Then, you can evaluate expressions in this context:

```
const r1 = evaluate('2 + 10 * 4', ctx)
assert.equal(r1.value, 42)
```

If something goes wrong evaluating the provided string, an error will be returned. Errors contain
the position information and so on to feed back to the user exactly what's gone wrong.

# Details

## Operators

Any of the following characters can be used to define an operator:

```
!Â£$%^&*@#~?<>|/\+=;:-
```

Operators can be binary (taking two arguments) or unary.

## Functions/variables

Functions/variables must start with an ascii character, and can then contain an ascii letter, number or underscore.

If you'd like to use a function as an operator, prefix it with a single quote `'`.

If the variable you ask for is not found in the `scope` object, the evaluator will return the string name of the
variable to the function/operator that's using it. This allows us to treat variables as basic string tokens when
there is no more sensible way of treating them.
